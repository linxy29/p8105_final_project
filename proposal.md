Motivation
==========

In this project, we want to apply what we learn in "Data Science I" to a dataset we interested in and get some useful and interesting results. As a results, we can not only practice our skills of collecting data as well as analyzing data but also create something meaningful.

Intended final products
=======================

After few weeks work, we hope that we can get a will-built website which shows our anlysis of the dataset and conclusions. This website will including our data source and some pictures created from data which reflect results. We will also make a short video which explain how we get our data, how we anlyze it and what results we get.

Anticipated data source
=======================

We will get our "mental health" data from [kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/home)

Planned challenges
==================

As this data is about mental health, the whole data, especially `Activity Types` variables contains lots of information, it is a great challengs for us to understand their relationship and get effective results.
